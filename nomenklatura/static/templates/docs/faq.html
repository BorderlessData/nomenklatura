<h3>What is deduplication mode?</h3>
<p>
  In review mode, you are prompted to decide if an entity is an alias for another entity, 
  or whether it should remain as it is. To make this easier, each entity is compared to
  all others in the dataset, and the most similar entities are shown as candidates.
