<h3>What is a dataset?</h3>
<p>
  A dataset is a logical unit of entities in nomenklatura. Examples of this could be all politicians in a country, all countries in the world or all companies involved in a
  particular context.
</p>
<p>
  Be aware that a dataset in nomenklatura doesn't have to correspond to a single data source. Names from a variety of origins can be combined and mapped together in a single dataset to integrate the data sources.
</p>


<h3>How do I add entities to a dataset?</h3>


<h3>What is review mode?</h3>
<p>
  In review mode, you are prompted to decide if an entity is an alias for another entity, 
  whether it is invalid or whether it should remain as it is. To make this easier, each
  entity is compared to all others in the dataset, and the most similar entities are shown
  as choices for you to see if there is an obvious duplicate.
</p>
<p>
  To make a change, just select the relevant option - another entity to merge with, or the 
  invalid option, and save the result.
</p>


<h3>What does marking an entity as invalid mean?</h3>
<p>
  Marking an entity as invalid is helpful when the entity was added to a dataset but doesn't actually make sense in the context of the dataset, i.e. when it is a category error.
</p>
<p>
  For example, imagine importing speaker names from a parliamentary transcript into nomenklatura. Instead of being marked with a speaker name, some speeches may be marked in the transcript with a piece of pseudo-naming like <strong>SPEAKER</strong>, which doesn't actually represent a person's name.
</p>


<h3>Can I delete an entity?</h3>
<p>
  Not at this moment. This will be implemented soon.
