# nomenklatura

Nomenklatura is an entity database for information about companies, people and their relationships. It provides a comprehensive interface and API to query, de-duplicate and integrate different entities - people, organisations or public bodies. It helps clean imported source data to turn it into domain-specific intelligence.
